Solid Hitboxes
=========

- Makes AI attacks collide with their allies
- [Optional] AI friendly fire (server synced)
- Toggle AI friendly fire on the fly with <code>/ai-ff on|off</code> command (NOTE: you need to be either host or admin to use it)

The point of this mod is to stop e.g. draugr archers from shooting through their team mates, which is not so fun if you use CLLC.

By default friendly fire is off because the AI still targets you through their friends.

This mod does not affect PvP Friendly Fire.

Troubleshooting
-----------
Everyone on the server needs to have same config. The mod should be installed on server and if there's any conflict, toggling the ff on or off will re-sync with all players.
